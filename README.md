# my_casa_tools

A collection of functions to be executed in CASA to simplify various tasks.
These functions were tailored to my needs in a specific project but may serve as a template for others as well. 
 
Documentation of the functions could be better but they are all simple in nature. Just have a look at the code to see what they do.

All functions in here are regular python functions, not CASA tasks. This is to run in a variety of CASA versions. Task need to be compiled for a specific CASA version and will generally not run in other versions.
